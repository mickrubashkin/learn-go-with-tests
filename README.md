# Learn Go With Tests - Practice Repository

This repository contains solutions and exercises based on the book
**Learn Go With Tests** by Chris James.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand Go fundamentals through a **test-driven approach (TDD)**.

---

### What this repository demonstrates

- Writing Go code using **tests as a design tool**
- Core Go concepts
- Clean, incremental commits following small TDD cycles
- Idiomatic Go style and standard tooling (`go test`, modules)

### Structure

Each folder corresponds to a chapter or concept from the book:

```
01_helloworld   - basic functions and testing
02_integers     - simple arithmetic and test coverage
03_iteration    - loops and repeat logic
```

Each directory is self-contained and can be tested independently.

### How to run tests

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Status

In progress.
Will be archived after completion as a finished learning exercise.

This repository is kept public intentionally to demonstrate:

- learning process
- code clarity
- testing mindset

### Credits

- Book: https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests
